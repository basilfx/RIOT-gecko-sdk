 * @brief Overview of support for various features across hardware platforms.
 *        These defines can be used at compile time to determine which
 *        features are available on your platform. However, keep in mind that
 *        these defines hold true for chip families. Your specific part
 *        may have further restrictions (band limitations, power amplifier
 *        restrictions, etc.) on top of those listed below. In general, an
 *        attempt to call an API that is not supported on your chip family as
 *        listed below will result in a \ref RAIL_STATUS_INVALID_CALL.
